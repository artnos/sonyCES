## Synopsis

The goal was to create a registration page that allowed visitors to sign up and choose the appropiate time, they wanted to come. Sony would then have a seperate login which allowed them to download the excel file of the people attending. This was a quick solution done in a week.

This was made with PHP and PHPExcel and PHP mailer. 

## Installation

I will try to add the sql table in the next update.

## License

Script is MIT licensed and free and will always be kept this way.
